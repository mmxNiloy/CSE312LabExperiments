# About
The project is about the lab experiments we've been assigned during our CSE-312 (OOP) course. The questions will be attached in a seperate branch of the same name. The answers will be pushed into master branch. If you're from my class, try not to copy-pasta everything, 'mkay?

The project structure is trivial and has been left as an exercise for the reader.

Since you're here, how about you listen to this banger of a song, eh?
